The ML-based CTC (Cost to Company) Range Predictor is designed to predict job applicants' income ranges based on their demographic and professional information. The aim is to assist companies in efficiently classifying job applicants into appropriate income brackets. The dataset consists of various features such as age, education level, occupation, and marital status, with the income (>50k or <=50k) serving as the target variable.
